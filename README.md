# Czech-English Dictionary Creator/Extender

This project uses the English-Czech dictionary from https://www.svobodneslovniky.cz to create a Czech-English dictionary and to add inflections to every word. You probably don't need to run this, but if you do, you first need to create the lemma database using [this](https://github.com/Vuizur/czech-inflections-lemmatizer).

The finished dictionaries are available here in Tabfile and Stardict format. Their license is GPL/CC-BY-SA-NonCommercial
